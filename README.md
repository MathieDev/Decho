# Decho
A custom implementation of the Echo VR APIs, written in Deno

## Running/Installation
Given this implementation uses Deno, you must install Deno. See https://deno.land/manual@v1.36.1/getting_started/installation for specific steps on how to install it for your system. Deno is available on most operating systems and can run on a variety of machines.

Then, once Deno is properly installed and available on the command-line, you can start Decho using 
```bash 
deno run ./mod.ts
```
