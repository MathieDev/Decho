# Decho

**This isn't finished and most likely wont be for a while.**

A custom implementation of the Echo VR APIs, written in [Deno](https://deno.land)

## Running/Installation

Given this implementation uses Deno, you must install Deno. See [Deno Installation](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation) for specific steps on how to install it for your system. Deno is available on most commonly used operating systems and kernels and can run on a variety of machines.

Then, once Deno is properly installed and available on the command-line, you can start [Decho](https://github.com/UnusualNorm/Decho) using

```bash
deno run -A mod.ts
```
